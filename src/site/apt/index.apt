CC-XJC

* Introduction

  CC-XJC is a JAXB 2.0 XJC plugin for adding a copy constructor to schema
  derived classes. The plugin provides a '-copy-constructor' option which is
  enabled by adding its jar file to the XJC classpath. That option takes no
  parameters. See the examples for further information.
